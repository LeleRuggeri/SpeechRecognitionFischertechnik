How to use Speech_Recognition_FRIC:

1. Run the Matlab software "Matlab_PLC_Connection" (Included in repo)
2. Press the physical connection button in the Fischertechnik robot arm system
3. Run the Matlab software "server.m" (Included in repo)
4. Run the "Speech_Recognition_FRIC" Python software
5. The software is now running and you can freely use it to move the robot!

In the "detection" folder there's a secondary copy of the exact same Python software to be used for debugging and testing!

Enjoy!
